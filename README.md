# Data Analytics Process – Real-Life Application

This repository contains a creative and relatable explanation of the **Data Analytics Process** using real-life examples. The objective of this assignment is to understand the core stages of data analytics through everyday decision-making and illustrate how we unconsciously apply these steps in our routine.

##  Overview

Data analytics isn’t limited to businesses or tech—it's something we use in our daily lives without even realizing it. Whether we’re deciding what to wear, where to travel, or what to eat, we analyze data, draw conclusions, and take action. 

This project demonstrates how a **shopping trip** can mirror the **six key stages** of the data analytics process: Plan, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

##  Real-Life Example: Going Shopping

### **1. Plan**
> *“We first decide what we need before going to the market.”*

Just like defining objectives in data analytics, planning involves identifying what you're shopping for—whether it’s a shirt, jeans, or footwear.

### **2. Prepare**
> *“Check how much you are willing to spend and how you’ll manage the money.”*

You determine your budget and gather resources, much like collecting and preparing data for analysis.

### **3. Process**
> *“Filter your needs—for example, deciding on slippers vs. shoes vs. sandals.”*

This is the step where raw data (options in the market) is filtered and organized to match your needs.

### **4. Analyze**
> *“You check trends, match colors, and see what fits well with what you already own.”*

Insights are drawn from the processed data to ensure your decisions are practical and trend-aware.

### **5. Share**
> *“You communicate your needs to the shopkeeper.”*

Much like sharing findings in a dashboard or presentation, this step involves conveying your insights to others involved in the decision-making process.

### **6. Act**
> *“You make the purchase!”*

Finally, you act on your analysis—just like businesses take action based on analytical insights.

##  Task

  
Think of another real-life situation where **data analytics is unknowingly applied**, and map it to the six stages of the analytics process.  

Examples:  
- Planning a trip  
- Choosing a restaurant  
- Studying for exams  
- Organizing a party

---

##  Skills Practiced

- Conceptual understanding of data analytics  
- Application of analytical thinking to real-world problems  
- Communication and storytelling through relatable examples

##  Conclusion

This project emphasizes how the principles of data analytics are deeply embedded in everyday life. By relating abstract analytical processes to common tasks, we gain a stronger foundational understanding of how to plan, analyze, and act on data. Recognizing this connection also helps develop critical thinking and decision-making skills applicable to both personal and professional contexts.
